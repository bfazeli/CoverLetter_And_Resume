				My name is Bijan Fazeli and I am a current student at Orange Coast College interested in applying for the Android internship position available for summer of '17. I'm currently living in Norwalk, Ca and thought that the job description as well as the location is a right fit for me. I became fascinated about Android development since the start of the quarter, and have ever since been eager to apply for an internship in Android development to gain valuable industry experience. I am a self-motivated, and self-drivin individual that works well both individually and alongside a team of developers in an agile work environment to solve quick problems by coming up with solutions and making documentations in order to communicate with clients as to what was wrong and what was fixed. I'll be publishing my first application to the google play store in the next coming months while. Currently, I am a student at Orange Coast college studying computer science, and plan on taking either a second bachelors or a master's in software engineering in the foreseeable future. Due to my diligent, hard working and motivational personality I feel that I am a right fit for this job which will allow me to expand my skill sets while helping to improve the existing project at your company.
